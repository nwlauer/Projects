State of the Arm 3/6/2017
Today we worked on improving the signal and code for the arm. We were able to get the activation threshold pretty low witht he proper placement of the sensor. We had trouble with the thumb servo as it seemed to keep breaking, likely a mixture of it being super cheap and the fact that we were feeding it 6 volts instead of 5. I will work on getting this working wit a new servo tonight. I also want to work on improving the code, making it straightforward and efficient.
