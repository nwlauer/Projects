Goals and Focus
=================

The goal this project was to replicate and improve upon the process for makine paper microfluidics put forth in [this paper by whitesides](https://gmwgroup.harvard.edu/pubs/pdf/1060.pdf). 

Outputs
=============

## Process Instructable

The Process that we found effective is outlined [here](https://www.instructables.com/id/Wax-Paper-Microfluidics/) on instructables.


## Modifications and Integration into Other Projects



Progress Log
=================


Like any project, especially one with complexities such as water flow, the learning process is that of trying a million things until you find one that works. I thought it helpful to document that process in a series of posts. After obtaining the printer, we went off Whitesides’ instructions(https://gmwgroup.harvard.edu/pubs/pdf/1060.pdf) reproducing a similar pattern to that in figure 3. D and E in the paper. The results as seen below were not very successful. Even after trying different “baking times” (in seconds written on the individual patterns) on a 150C kitchen pan, all seemed to have the water leak outside the boundaries. Looking back the main two issues that I believed caused this was too large of a reservoir with walls not thick enough and the the wax not penetrating fully through the paper. As will be seen in future parts of this series of post some of these problems will be pervasive and some will be solved.
