===================

(7/17/2018)

I am starting off with a unit that I have used that uses a peristaltic pump and a motor speed control unit. I want to instead use a diaphramgm pump and an h bridge unit run by an ATtiny. The diaphram pump promisies more pressure then can be acheived by a perastatic motor, the problem being that these motors are rather expensive, however searching ebay I found ..... that seems promising.
