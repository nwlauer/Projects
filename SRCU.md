While I am waiting for some parts to come in the following is pictures of the orginal design using a peristaltic pump and a motor speed and direction controler(assembled circuit from amazon esentially just an H bidge and some pwm control).

I am starting off with a unit that I have used that uses a peristaltic pump and a motor speed control unit. I want to instead use a diaphramgm pump and an h bridge unit run by an ATtiny. The diaphram pump promisies more pressure then can be acheived by a perastatic motor, the problem being that these motors are rather expensive, however searching ebay I found ..... that seems promising.
