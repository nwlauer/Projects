### Goal and Focus
  This project revolves mostly around the fabrication of a soft robotic system out of a flexible filament that requires no post       processing after printing.

### Progress

Original trials were made to heat the actuators in the oven after printing which while still considered post processing the print is minimal when compared to other techniques(dipping in sealent). Later in printing it was found that this process was unneeded as I was getting reasonably air tight actuators in just increasing the extrustion muliplier (1.5 to 2) depending on printer and filament. I have been able to get away with two perimeters and still create a good acuator, the top and bottom layers have to be a bit more, however this may be a limit of the design having the walls so close together and the slicer having trouble getting good solid infill.
